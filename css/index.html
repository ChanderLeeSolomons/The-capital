         <h3>Video gaming is clearly a popular form of entertainment, with video gamers collectively spending 3 billion hours per week in front of their screens. Due to their widespread use, scientists have researched how video games affect the brain and behavior.</h3>

            The best video games are challenging. Pushing through those challenges can teach us perseverance as well as personal accountability—learning how to focus on our own actions and what we can control to improve the situations around us.
            Exercise Your Brain and Improve Problem-Solving Skills.The jury’s still out on whether playing video games can make us smarter, but researchers have found that parts of the brain (related to memory, muscle control, strategic planning, and spatial navigation) can get bigger as a result of playing. Again, this doesn’t necessarily mean we get smarter as a result, but the findings suggest video gaming can be used to treat some brain disorders.
            Relax and Relieve Anxiety and Stress.For many people, playing video games is much-needed downtime. The psychological benefits of playing video games can carry over into real life when they relieve stress and anxiety.
            Meet New People.Multi-tasking isn’t great for our productivity in general, but it might be possible to get better at it, even if you’re not a natural “supertasker.”
